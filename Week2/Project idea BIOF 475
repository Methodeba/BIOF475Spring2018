By the end of the class I want to be able to build a beast machine that will use NVIDIA CUDA libraries 9. to analyse NLP data for trending.
The idea is to learn the process necessary to actually parse words from many documents and create a body or corpus of words.
Then, use different algorithms in conjunction with tensorflow to create a training and testing randomly selected data base of documents,
using what I have learned from the parsing excercise, and begin to create an objective functions parameters.  The idea is to find
precursors to tragic events and identify them with the model, and then use the objective function, tensorflow, to examine other documents
as they become available to find situations where the precursors exist, but the events haven't occurred.
As the semester progresses, I will modify this first iteration with the learnings as they come with respect to the different processes
of deep learning techniques.
